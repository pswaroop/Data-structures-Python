'''
A tuple in Python is an immutable, ordered collection of elements. 
Its immutability makes it hashable, so tuples can be used as dictionary keys 
or elements of a set, unlike lists.

sample_tuple = (1,2,3)
my_tuple = ("hello",1,2,"hi",2.46)
single_tuple = tuple((1,2,3))
nested_tuple = (1, (2, 3), 4)
